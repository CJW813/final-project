    "\n",
    "### Motivation:\n",
    "This is my first time filing US tax and the tax system is Soooooo complicated.  It would be great to have a simple tax calculater.\n",
    "Note: this DC tax calculater is just for fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "You just need to enter your name, gross income, marital status, are you blind or over 65 years old, then you will get a number showing the tax you need to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruction:\n",
    "name: Please enter your name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "gross income: Please enter your gross income.  Which should be a number >= 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "marital status: Please enter either \"Single\" or \"Married\" (Case sensitive)\n",
    "\n",
    "blind: If you AND your spouse are blind, please enter \"2\"; if you OR your spouse are blind, please enter \"1\"; else please enter \"0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "over 65: If you AND your spouse are over 65, please enter \"2\"; if you OR your spouse are over 65, please enter \"1\"; else please enter \"0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please noted that all of the information you entered are separated by SPACE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "John is a 65 lonely old man.  He is not blind and his gross income is $50000.\n",
    "John should enter:\n",
    "    \n",
    "John 50000 Single 0 1"
